# WildVetCheckinSystem
A checkin website for a Vet clinic based in Sydney. The task was to allow clients to check-in Online by scanning a QR code, allowing them to enter their personal details as well as their pet info.
After Successful checkin, the Reception at the Vet is notified of the new checkin and they can send relevent links related to the pet as email to the client before the pet is seen y the doctor.
The Receptionist also acts as the admin and can perform CRUD Operations on the DB.
There are also doctor profiles where they can log in and check the clients assigned to them on that day.
